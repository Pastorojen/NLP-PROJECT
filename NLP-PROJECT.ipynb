now i have been wearing it for awhile now and it is perfect! no regrets buying this ring at all!great ring! i tried a different one first but the individual rings were so thin that they snapped within a few weeks. the rings on this one are thicker, making it a bolder and more durable ring. of course it costs a bit more but you can't go wrong paying for better quality!i bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the coach store and liked the style. this one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! it's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. i am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. i think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. she wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. i would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!i owned a triple roll ring which each of the three rings slowly broke, so i purchased this which so far, none of the individual rings have broken yet.i love this ring because the flowers go all the way around the ring and it fits my ring finger so if i ever find mr. right he doesn't have to buy me an engagement ring, he can just use this as my engagement ring, as i am not into getting into debt before marriage.my wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. we were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. but what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. the cubic zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but i believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the banki ordered this ring for myself last december, and when i opened the ring box when it arrived, it absolutely took my breath away. what a gorgeous ring! the pictures don't do it justice. the size and color of the stone suit my taste perfectly, and the quality of the ring is excellent. i have quite a variety of silver rings, and this ring is one that i wear on a regular basis. my taste in rings is more toward the bold/unique side, and this ring definitely fits the bill!\n",

      "i bought this as a gift for a friends birthday and she loved it. it's a beautifull ring.i got this ring as a gift from my boyfriend and i love it. the only thing is that if the rings are not position correctly it pinches the skin.my only wish on this ring is- i wish the cut potrion went all the way around the ring. other than that a great very comfortable ring.my husband loves it only thing is you cant have this ring resized due to the way the ring is mademy second engagement ring got it on my birthday i love this nice and shinny lol must buy ring for anyonei love the ring its not a ring that you would want to wear as an everyday ring the claws that hold the stone in are very sharp and get stuck on things and have scratched mei love this ring fits just right and i showed my daughter the ring and she loved it as well. great for everyday wear and the price was great..i bought this ring for my husband and he loved it. i received it when they said i would and it is a great ringi love the ring and suggest every girl should have this ring in their jewelry collection.i absolutely love this ring! i got this as my engagement ring feb 09 this ring is beautiful and durable.this ring is perfect i say why spend thousands when you don't have to? the ring shines perfectly i love this ring!i love rings. i need more pinky rings and it's hard to find size 4 rings that aren't just for children. this ring is nice. it's a nice flower ring that is perfect as a pinky ring for me.i wanted to know if this ring is like 2 rings in one, because this ring is beyond gorgeous, i just love it.i wanted to know if this ring is like 2 rings in one, because this ring is beyond gorgeous, i just love it.i love my birthstone and i wanted a piece of jewelry that symbolized the simple purity of the blue topaz. this ring did that for me. as a gift to myself for my birthday this year, it was definitely a great gift and a welcomed addition to my collection.my mother loved this and was a great birthday gift. these look even better in person and go great with anything.this product made for a great gift and great memorize for my love and me. it something we will always have. a helping gift from the heart that always shows you care.this was a birthday gift for my 16 yo niece. she loves the ring and was very happy to have received it.i always love willow tree. they make great gifts for great people in your life. i have quite a collection, and i hope to continue to build ita great gift to your loved one and an ever better seller. the seller deals with you in the most professional way and the security measures are superb.my neice loves her birth stone so i got it for her for a christmas gift.i also love it also. greati love the ring it shines beautiful its looks so real anyone who like to buy one this is the ring the stones are a good size my friends love the ring it could pass for a real diamond i love the ring its worth the money its better then the ring i bought from avon it was silver and had cubic z no shine to the ring but this ring i bought with the 3 stones its worth the price anne mariethis ring is exactly what i wanted, i actually bought another and it wasn't quite as solidly made as this ring is. thanks for the great ring!i bought this ring as a valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). it's a cute ring so i just kept it for myself.i've owned several claddagh rings over the years and lost my last one. i received this one as a gift recently and i truly love it. it's sturdy and the design is crisp. i can easily recommend this one as a lovely ring.i reciently lost a ring very much like this one and was searching high and low for another ring to replace the one i lost and came across this ring. this ring is absolutely the most brilliant ring to look at. it shines and sparkels like little diamonds. i just love this ring. and would reccomend it to anyone who wants a ring that is elegent and afordable at the same time.i do love this ring and i wear it all the time. i bought it to wear when my husband and i go on vacation so i don't have to worry about losing my real ring. the stone is already lose but it is a $50 ring and not a $5000 ring. almost every time i leave the house i get a compliment on this ring. my mom cannot tell the different between this ring and my real wedding ring. it is a little bulkier then the picture leads one to believe, but it is still a wonderful ring. if anything happens and the stone does fall out, i will probably buy another ring because of how much i love this ring.my fiance and i looked at many different rings and i fell in love with this ring, it was everything i wanted in an engagement ring! now i have been wearing it for awhile now and it is perfect! no regrets buying this ring at all!great ring! i tried a different one first but the individual rings were so thin that they snapped within a few weeks. the rings on this one are thicker, making it a bolder and more durable ring. of course it costs a bit more but you can't go wrong paying for better quality!i bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the coach store and liked the style. this one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! it's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. i am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. i think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. she wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. i would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!i owned a triple roll ring which each of the three rings slowly broke, so i purchased this which so far, none of the individual rings have broken yet.i love this ring because the flowers go all the way around the ring and it fits my ring finger so if i ever find mr. right he doesn't have to buy me an engagement ring, he can just use this as my engagement ring, as i am not into getting into debt before marriage.my wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. we were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. but what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. the cubic zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but i believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the banki ordered this ring for myself last december, and when i opened the ring box when it arrived, it absolutely took my breath away. what a gorgeous ring! the pictures don't do it justice. the size and color of the stone suit my taste perfectly, and the quality of the ring is excellent. i have quite a variety of silver rings, and this ring is one that i wear on a regular basis. my taste in rings is more toward the bold/unique side, and this ring definitely fits the bill!this ring is awesome! i wear the ring on my index finger and it fits great! comfortable ring.this ring is awesome! i wear the ring on my index finger and it fits great! comfortable ring.my wife loves the ring, it was a great gift. extremelly cheap and high quality.this ring has such a good sparkle and it looks like a ring that should cost 10x the amount. makes a great gift for someone on a budget. my girlfriend loves it.i got the ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend for christmas and she loved it. definitely a great value.eve's addiction was wonderful with sending the ring and the ring is beautiful; my daughter waas thrilled with the ring. thank you, dorothy\n",

      "i expect like regular size of ring,but this one look like a ring for toy or something funy, the MM of our rings is 5MM and this ring may be is 1MMso ridiculousMartin1/5 ct.tw Round Diamond Solitaire Ring in 18k White GoldI ordered a ring that stated Toe Ring\" in the description. The ring came very quickly but was not a toe ring. I don't know anyone with a size 8 toe. If you know anyone please direct them to this seller! Is it a wedding band, toe ring or thumb ring? Pick one!This ring is a beautiful ring but the first shipment of this ring had scratches on the diamond and was missing 2 diamonds on the shoulder of the ring. I returned the ring for a replacement of the same ring, the second ring was even worse. Clearly visible white scratch right in the middle of a black diamond does not look that great. And this time 1 diamond missing on the shoulder of the ring. I returned it for a refund. Thanks alot Amazon.This ring is a beautiful ring but the first shipment of this ring had scratches on the diamond and was missing 2 diamonds on the shoulder of the ring.

And this time 1 diamond missing on the shoulder of the ring. I returned it for a refund. Thanks alot Amazon.This is a huge waste of money I had it for about a month when the part that holds the symbol to the necklace broke. I seriously not wasting your money on this low quality itemThe quality and look were not what I had anticipated. Very flimsy.I would not recommend this itemThe quality of this item was not up to expectations.The Top was scratched, the hinges did not line up to the pre-drilled holes and the staining was inconsistant. If I saw this item in a store I would not have purchased it.hard and can't wear it, the material is hard and not easy to wear I just don't like it I should have saved my money and got on from A&EVery disappointed in the appearance and quality of the bracelet and its definitely not worth $45.00 - not even close.I bought this bracelet for my girlfriend and I was not very impressed with the quality. The bracelet itself looks cheap and the clasp is extremely fragile, in fact the first night she wore the bracelet out the clasp broke on one side. I definitely would not recommend this bracelet.This bracelet is poor quality of gemstones and poor craftsmanship. Gemstones are very cloudy and some of the joints in the chain or fused together and the bracelet therefore can't be straightened out completely. In other words, if you unfasten the bracelet and lay it out on the counter it will not form a straight line because some of the joints in the bracelet are fused together and do not bend so you cannot straighten the bracelet. Don't buy this, it's junk.I purchased this bracelet as a gift last December. The quality of the clasp is quite poor and it gradually lost it ability to stay closed. Recently, the bracelet fell off because of the poor clasp and was damaged greatly. Avoid this bracelet!The item was not as pictured. It is funky and of poor quality. The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this.This product was hollow, which was not clearly specified in the item description. It was not what I was expecting and seemed to be poor quality. I returned the item.Disappointed by quality of item. Too fragile and thin and discolored on back of charm. If not returnable I will not be ordering from Amazon or this jeweler in the future. Thank youThe item was misrepresented. Size and quality were horrible. I would return this item except family member is in the Coast Guard and it was sent to him. A total waste of money.This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this backThis rings looks nothing like the picture at all! The stones are so small I can barely even tell they are stones, then the ring is so thin and small. It looks like a ring I would buy in a egg from a machine. I returned it promptly. This was a very misleading buy.I didn't like this product because the diamonds looked nothing like the picture. The diamonds are flawed more than a little bit.Although the picture shows a cute looking ring this ring isn't pretty. The fringed look, only looks like the ring has been left on the floor and someone ran it over with a vaccum cleaner.This ring looks beautiful in the picture but when you see it in reality, the cubic zirconia so small and the ring looks so tiny. Also, the cubic zirconia is dull. The ring I received looks like it was worn. Very disgusted with my purchase. Won't buy from this seller again. I do not like false imaging. The ring looks cheap and should be sold for much less. A real rip-off!It looks like a ring for a man when you look at the picture online, but in real life its a very feminine looking ring.These are not what I thought they were going to be they look good in the picture but when I got them the quality just isn't there. I can't wear them with out completely bending the hooks out of shape. They are more like silver plastic.\n",

      "I wanted to know if this ring is like 2 rings in one, because this ring is beyond gorgeous, I just love it.Nice ring for the an inexpensive ring, but one stone was missing. It was not worth returning it as you would pay more for postage than what the ring cost.wore this toe ring one day and POOF the stone was gone so it sits in a pile of other broken sterling silver rings and thingsRing is way too small and looks like a toy when putting it on. I would not recommend if you want a nice 1/2 carat ring.I only had it a week before one of the jewels fell out of the wing. The metal is already tarnishing too. Spend your money on a higher quality item.its what i wanted :) but its not my favorite piercing of mine but i have to wear the bioplast cuz i break out with certain metalsIt serves the purpose, but it seemed to me that the image was a lot prettier and sparklier than it turned out to be. I wear it UNDER my shirt since it does not compliment anything I wear.the bracelet was not a true 9  the necklace perfect the bracelet nice quality just not true to lengthThe stones on this bracelet are extremely pale, more pink than purple. I ended up returning the bracelet because I have amethyst jewelry and it was extremely poor quality.Item was shipped and received within the time limit given. Good quality product t t t t t t tItem arrived extremely damaged in several places. Not packaged well had to send it back. Very disappointed with the quality.The ring was nice and looked like picture but had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip.I usually love rings from this company but be warned that this ring doesn't look anything like the picture. The ring I received had a super long rectangular stone, not a nice square as seen in the picture. Mine was also tarnished or looked like it had torch marks up the side. I will definitely be returning this ring.I got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. If you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small. If you are a man looking to buy a ring for his significant other, I would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. I ended up returning it.I fell in love with the picture. The ring showed to be sligthly brushed looking. When the ring arrived I was quick to learn the picture looks nothing like the ring. The ring is a bright polish and the yellow gold is barely visiable. I'm very disappointed with amazon for the lack of description.It was much smaller than it looked like in the picture and the silver necklace seemed to be of poorer quality than expected.The diamond had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip.\n",

And this time 1 diamond missing on the shoulder of the ring. I returned it for a refund. Thanks alot Amazon.very nice small sized ring I can stack it with other rings for different looksI got this ring for my birthday and I love it, I cannot imagine a woman not adoring this ring.I was at first skeptical about this ring as the price was very low and I don't wear a lot of gold. I purchased the ring as I have a few nice gold necklaces I wear and I wanted a ring to work with them all. The ring doesn't look like a $35 ring.This ring is awesome! I wear the ring on my index finger and it fits great! Comfortable ring.Not only is the ring beautiful, the jeweler was very accommadating in having the ring reach us in time. We appreciate the care and quick receiving of the ring. Thank you!I love the ring its not a ring that you would want to wear as an everyday ring the claws that hold the stone in are very sharp and get stuck on things and have scratched meI bought this ring as a Valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). It's a cute ring so I just kept it for myself.This ring was a little too small for my ring finger. It would have been better as a pinky ring.The ring is pretty enough, but the metal of the ring is very insubstantial it pushes in very easily.my husband loves it only thing is you cant have this ring resized due to the way the ring is madeThe ring is pretty but very flexible which turned out good for me because I ordered for my ring finger and the size of it made it look better as a pinkie ring.They definitely help lessen your appitite, however my ears were sore after wearing for about 3 hours and the next few days I tried to wear them off and on and to increase the wearing time. If you have a good pain tolerance you may not notice any discomfort, as for me my ears lobes were swollen and I had to stop wearing them for 4 days.The product arrived in a very short period of time and was perfect. It was described perfectly and was everything I had hopedThis is one of the most beautiful rosarys I have seen. The smoothness and color of the beads is so translucent looking that it almost looks like glass. The workmanship is excellent and the details are beautiful. A truly beautiful piece to own.I was a little disappointed when I received my ring in the mail. In the picture provided above the sides look like they make a heart shape, or at least it looks like smooth, clean curved lines. The ring I got in the mail looks like the sides are smushed in and not clean curves. Other then that I like it. I just wished it looked like the picture.I received my ring and was a little disappointed that the ring is not completely blue (like the picture shows). It looks like I got a blue flower with green leaves. So it makes the ring look blue and green. Very small ring. Not worth $6.99 but more like $3.This ring is alot smaller in person than in pictures, the pictures make it look like the diamonds are decent size and they are very small, I was a little disappointed.From the picture they looked to have some purple in them but they are clear just like the title says.Although the picture looks like metal beads and description states sterling silver, these are pearls.I really liked these earrings. However, i agree with one of the earlier reviews that I thought they would have been a little bigger.\n",

      "i got 3 belly rings 3 tongue rings 3 lip rings and a 16g cbr. all the stuff i got was cool, i love the pink peace sign tongue ring :) the only complaint is that i got 2 yellow lip rings and im not much for yellow, overall very happyI a similar ring off of a auction site. The flaw lies in the middle part of the ring, being that its a complete ring it cuts down on the flexiblity of the over all joint. I ended up taking mine to a silver smith and had him remove the back section of the middle ring and it really helped out with the flexibilityI a similar ring off of a auction site. The flaw lies in the middle part of the ring, being that its a complete ring it cuts down on the flexiblity of the over all joint. I ended up taking mine to a silver smith and had him remove the back section of the middle ring and it really helped out with the flexibilitymy only wish on this ring is- I wish the cut potrion went all the way around the ring. Other than that a great very comfortable ring.The ring was shipped accordingly and I love the shipping pace. The ring itself is beautiful, the only thing I don't care for is there is a line where it looks like the ring may have been re-sized. Inclduing all the specifications I included the ring has met my expectations especially for a beginning ring.My husband wears a size 10 and the ring was too tight so I now I have a new thumb ring. I guess you shouldn't order some things online. But it is a cute ringI have been told that the ring is very comfortable to wear and he was quite surprised and please to see the Masonic ring in titanium.I haven't even ordered this ring but i read the reviews for it. If you notice picture 1 and pictures 2/3 are two different rings. I was going to order the ring but it seems that the ring received is the 2nd/3rd ring which has a smaller cross design.Your picture of this rings shows blue sapphires so I was disappointed to see that the ring I received has such dark stones that they appear black. The ring is definitely NOT as advertised.This is my favorite ring. Also one of the first rings I ever bought. So if you are new to buying pewter rings, here's something that may help you out. Pewter rings tend to be a bit more bulkier than other types of rings and the metal is softer. Past that I liked this ring, the design of the dead bugs and snakes catches a lot of attention.the product came very fast and was just like how amazon explained itthe ring is very clearly written NO WAR and thick which i likebut i guess if you like small rings this isnt your ringvery nice small sized ring I can stack it with other rings for different looksThis is an attractive and high quality item for a young teenager. It is too small for an adult.I could see the quality work in this rosary. I was pleased when I opened the container and I could immediately smell olive wood. There was only one thing buyers need to be aware of when buying this item that wasn't mentioned in the description. The Holy Land Sand is present in a compartment on the rosary. In my opinion, this adds to the quality of the rosary so I'm not sure why the seller didn't describe this fact. I'll be looking for more items from this seller.i love this ring my only complaint is that the metal is so soft that it bent to the point that i couldnt wear it anymore. i still wear it on a necklace and love it on occasion i can squish it onto my fingure but it took less than two months for it to be almost impossible for me to wear.What sparkle. It is so pretty and dainty. Just what I was looking for.This is a solid.beautiful ring. But if you are expecting the color in rhe picture you will be disappointed. It is barely pink at all. When I first saw it I thought it was lavendar. It's still pretty but buy for design not color.This is a beautiful piece. I looked for a long time to replace the hamsa hand that was given to me in Egypt. This one is perfect. It's delicate and sturdy and lovely to look at. The detail is so pretty and elegant. I wear it oftenThis was a birthday gift for my 16 YO niece. She loves the ring and was very happy to have received it.I always love Willow Tree. they make great gifts for great people in your life. I have quite a collection, and I hope to continue to build itI received this Italian horn in pristine condition and I was completely satisfied with the receiving of this product in a timely manner.the product arrived in perfect condition but the shipping is ridiculously slow. i will not order from them again.My item came quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas. They were a huge hit with the person who received themThis pendant I classify as the best for casual wear. I wear on the weekends or out & about but isn't not suited for my work or my going out eventsI am looking forward to wearing them as they sparkle and catch every eye at my son's wedding on June 30I wear this charm in memory of 3 friends that have passed away. I wish I didn't have to wear it but it is in their honor that I do.The Earrings you sent me are real light in color not the pretty dark color you show in the picture. They look almost light pink. I will keep them they are also pretty but not what I expected.The diamond looks pretty big. For the price, it shines brilliantly. The color doesn't look very white though. But you don't expect K color to be very white. Overall, I think it's pretty. and I am very happy with it.The message is very positive and it looks very pretty. I bought it for my aunt as a present and the color is very nice.The diamonds in the picture are nothing close to the size they look in the picture but the ring is awesome and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone for the price. Hands down, no doubt. The ring looks amazing for the price. Just don't expect the diamonds to look as big as they do in the picture.the earrings are as in the picture, stones look good and are light and comfortable, reasonable quality for the price. The silver does not look as in the picture but just like polished silver.\n",

      "I bought two of these rings to fit on either side of my own platinum princess wedding ring to help anchor and to add to the ring. Perfect fit! I have had a lot of compliments on my new ring\".This ring is perfect I say why spend thousands when you don't have to? The ring shines perfectly I love this ring!Eve's Addiction was wonderful with sending the ring and the ring is beautiful; my daughter waas thrilled with the ring. Thank you, Dorothymy girlfriend especially enjoys this ring because of the thickness of the ring band. In the past she has had similar rings but has always been frustrated by the flimsy ring band, but this ring has a nice solid band.I absolutely love this ring! I got this as my engagement ring Feb 09 This ring is beautiful and durable.I love this ring because the flowers go all the way around the ring and it fits my ring finger so if I ever find Mr. Right he doesn't have to buy me an engagement ring, he can just use this as my engagement ring, as I am not into getting into debt before marriage.This ring is gorgeous and fits right in with the other sterling silver Celtic rings that I have. I was a little worried at first with the size of the band since it's a 10 and I wear a 9 but the band is very wide and the ring fits perfectly and is hardly loose at all. Even though this is a mans ring it isn't to big or clunky, a must have for all lovers of Celtic rings! The ring also arrived very quickly which is the same for the other ring I bought from this company, I would definitely do business with them again!Bought this ring as a thumb ring everyone notices it and comments about how pretty and cool it looks then when I spin it they want to know where I got it I would recommend this ring to any one also very comfy.i love the ring it shines beautiful its looks so real anyone who like to buy one this is the ring the stones are a good size my friends love the ring it could pass for a real diamond i love the ring its worth the money its better then the ring i bought from avon it was silver and had cubic z no shine to the ring but this ring i bought with the 3 stones its worth the price anne marieI owned a triple roll ring which each of the three rings slowly broke, so I purchased this which so far, none of the individual rings have broken yet.I love rings. I need more pinky rings and it's hard to find size 4 rings that aren't just for children. This ring is nice. It's a nice flower ring that is perfect as a pinky ring for me.I bought this ring for my old prom date it's a beautiful ring and fair price so any guy looking to save money until he afford that Engagement ring definitely get this.This ring is just lovely!While advertised as a pinky ring, I actually wear it as a thumb ring.Im unfortunately a small woman, my ring size is a 4 so its almost impossible to purchase rings without having them sized. I purchased this ring so that I would have something to wear while on vacation and doing things that could otherwise harm my expensive rings. I dont even need my expensive rings now. This ring fits and looks beautiful!This works perfectly for my rings and my wider rings - both narrow and wide.This ring is just absolutely stunning and beautiful! I would recommend this amethyst ring to anyone who is in the market for a reasonably priced amethyst ring.I reciently lost a ring very much like this one and was searching high and low for another ring to replace the one I lost and came across this ring. This ring is absolutely the most brilliant ring to look at. It shines and sparkels like little Diamonds. I just love this ring. and would reccomend it to anyone who wants a ring that is elegent and afordable at the same time.Still wearing the pinky ring with the trinity knotFinally have a pinky ring that does not turn my finger greengot this for my gf not as an enguagement ring and much to my supprize it was two rings which fit together to make 1. it looked like just one ring in the picture. i must say it is a beautiful ring which always catches peoples attentionI love the ring and suggest every girl should have this ring in their jewelry collection.My wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. We were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. But what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. The Cubic Zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. Me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but I believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.Great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the bankI checked around jewelry stores for prices and I couldn't find any rings that could even compare to this! It is not a huge ring but it is definitely not microscopic either. I bought this ring to go along with my solitaire engagement ring and it makes a perfect replacement to a plain wedding band. I am really glad that I decided to go with this ring, even though I was kind of nervous ordering a ring online.I bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the Coach store and liked the style. This one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! It's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. I am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. I think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. She wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. I would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!I do love this ring and I wear it all the time. I bought it to wear when my husband and I go on vacation so I don't have to worry about losing my real ring. The stone is already lose but it is a $50 ring and not a $5000 ring. Almost every time I leave the house I get a compliment on this ring. My mom cannot tell the different between this ring and my real wedding ring. It is a little bulkier then the picture leads one to believe, but it is still a wonderful ring. If anything happens and the stone does fall out, I will probably buy another ring because of how much I love this ring.This ring is exactly what I wanted, I actually bought another and it wasn't quite as solidly made as this ring is. Thanks for the great ring!This gorgeous ring holder sits on my dresser and holds my wedding ring every night. It's gorgeous and I love it!I ordered this ring for myself last December, and when I opened the ring box when it arrived, it absolutely took my breath away. What a gorgeous ring! The pictures don't do it justice. The size and color of the stone suit my taste perfectly, and the quality of the ring is excellent. I have quite a variety of silver rings, and this ring is one that I wear on a regular basis. My taste in rings is more toward the bold/unique side, and this ring definitely fits the bill!I bought this ring in a size 3 for a toe ring. It came much sooner than expected, this was the first surprise. Second surprise was the absolutely cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top that the ring came in! And the third surprise was the ring itself which fit perfectly and was totally true to the picture and looked even better in person. I'm already shopping for my second Gem Avenue ring!Kudos to Gem Avenue for supplying small rings for people who like fitted toe rings!!Im unfortunately a small woman so its almost impossible to purchase rings without having them sized. I purchased this ring so that I would have something to wear while on vacation and doing things that could otherwise harm my expensive rings. I dont even need my expensive rings now. This ring is stunning, delicate, and beautiful. This ring fits and looks awesum!this ring is just the right one for everyone who want a beautiful ring on there hand that it will catch everyone's attention.Great ring!

      "i do love this ring and i wear it all the time. i bought it to wear when my husband and i go on vacation so i don't have to worry about losing my real ring. the stone is already lose but it is a $50 ring and not a $5000 ring. almost every time i leave the house i get a compliment on this ring. my mom cannot tell the different between this ring and my real wedding ring. it is a little bulkier then the picture leads one to believe, but it is still a wonderful ring. if anything happens and the stone does fall out, i will probably buy another ring because of how much i love this ring.i reciently lost a ring very much like this one and was searching high and low for another ring to replace the one i lost and came across this ring. this ring is absolutely the most brilliant ring to look at. it shines and sparkels like little diamonds. i just love this ring. and would reccomend it to anyone who wants a ring that is elegent and afordable at the same time.my fiance and i looked at many different rings and i fell in love with this ring, it was everything i wanted in an engagement ring! now i have been wearing it for awhile now and it is perfect! no regrets buying this ring at all!i love the ring it shines beautiful its looks so real anyone who like to buy one this is the ring the stones are a good size my friends love the ring it could pass for a real diamond i love the ring its worth the money its better then the ring i bought from avon it was silver and had cubic z no shine to the ring but this ring i bought with the 3 stones its worth the price anne mariei love this ring because the flowers go all the way around the ring and it fits my ring finger so if i ever find mr. right he doesn't have to buy me an engagement ring, he can just use this as my engagement ring, as i am not into getting into debt before marriage.i love this ring! it is very snug because of the thickness of this ring,if you are wanting to buy this ring, buy it a size larger.the ring is just beautiful and although i bought it b/c both my boys have autismi am using it as new wedding band since i go through rings so often.i don't think i will ever have to replace this ring and am going to buy my hubby one too.i bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the coach store and liked the style. this one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! it's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. i am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. i think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. she wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. i would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!i ordered this ring for myself last december, and when i opened the ring box when it arrived, it absolutely took my breath away. what a gorgeous ring! the pictures don't do it justice. the size and color of the stone suit my taste perfectly, and the quality of the ring is excellent. i have quite a variety of silver rings, and this ring is one that i wear on a regular basis. my taste in rings is more toward the bold/unique side, and this ring definitely fits the bill!my second engagement ring got it on my birthday i love this nice and shinny lol must buy ring for anyonemy wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. we were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. but what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. the cubic zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but i believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the banki usually love rings from this company but be warned that this ring doesn't look anything like the picture. the ring i received had a super long rectangular stone, not a nice square as seen in the picture. mine was also tarnished or looked like it had torch marks up the side. i will definitely be returning this ring.i bought this ring as a valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). it's a cute ring so i just kept it for myself.i've owned several claddagh rings over the years and lost my last one. i received this one as a gift recently and i truly love it. it's sturdy and the design is crisp. i can easily recommend this one as a lovely ring.i owned a triple roll ring which each of the three rings slowly broke, so i purchased this which so far, none of the individual rings have broken yet.this ring is gorgeous and fits right in with the other sterling silver celtic rings that i have. i was a little worried at first with the size of the band since it's a 10 and i wear a 9 but the band is very wide and the ring fits perfectly and is hardly loose at all. even though this is a mans ring it isn't to big or clunky, a must have for all lovers of celtic rings! the ring also arrived very quickly which is the same for the other ring i bought from this company, i would definitely do business with them again!i checked around jewelry stores for prices and i couldn't find any rings that could even compare to this! it is not a huge ring but it is definitely not microscopic either. i bought this ring to go along with my solitaire engagement ring and it makes a perfect replacement to a plain wedding band. i am really glad that i decided to go with this ring, even though i was kind of nervous ordering a ring online.the ring was shipped accordingly and i love the shipping pace. the ring itself is beautiful, the only thing i don't care for is there is a line where it looks like the ring may have been re-sized. inclduing all the specifications i included the ring has met my expectations especially for a beginning ring.this ring is just absolutely stunning and beautiful! i would recommend this amethyst ring to anyone who is in the market for a reasonably priced amethyst ring.bought this ring as a thumb ring everyone notices it and comments about how pretty and cool it looks then when i spin it they want to know where i got it i would recommend this ring to any one also very comfy.i love my birthstone and i wanted a piece of jewelry that symbolized the simple purity of the blue topaz. this ring did that for me. as a gift to myself for my birthday this year, it was definitely a great gift and a welcomed addition to my collection.i got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. if you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small. if you are a man looking to buy a ring for his significant other, i would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. i ended up returning it.i got 3 belly rings 3 tongue rings 3 lip rings and a 16g cbr. all the stuff i got was cool, i love the pink peace sign tongue ring :) the only complaint is that i got 2 yellow lip rings and im not much for yellow, overall very happygot this for my gf not as an enguagement ring and much to my supprize it was two rings which fit together to make 1. it looked like just one ring in the picture. i must say it is a beautiful ring which always catches peoples attentioni bought this ring for my old prom date it's a beautiful ring and fair price so any guy looking to save money until he afford that engagement ring definitely get this.\n",
